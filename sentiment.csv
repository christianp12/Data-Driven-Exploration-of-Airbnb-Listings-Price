<br/>      Besides the apartment there were some complications with signing a security deposit.

<br/>  We loved Barcelona! It is a great place for people who still would love to swim in the sea and spent some time on the beach; but at the same time visit just amazing sights that the historical city can offer. Make sure to buy your tickets to Sagrada Familia and Park Guell online the day before. You will not be able to get in right away. Try to visit Sagrada Familia on the sunny day so as the colorful lightening through the windows inside the cathedral becomes just amazing!,0.0

It did function like that for the first 24 hours but then the system failed completely and despite being reassured on the phone that it would be fixed it was not while we were there and we spent our last 24 hours unable to have a shower and were only able to wash with hot water from the kettle.,0.0

<br/>On sunday we wanted to leave a bit later at 13 o'clock and Ewa had no problem with that.,0.0
<br/>On the roof is a nice terrace were you can eat or take a sunbath. ,0.0
<br/>On the very last day I dropped a glass and it was a total mess and I felt very bad about it. But Camilo told me not to worry. I promised him that I was going to buy a new one and so I did. Camilo also let us use the washing machine to wash some clothes as we stayed in the room for 10 days.,0.0
<br/>One little problem is that there is noise coming from the street at the rooms located above it.,0.0
<br/>One of the Showers need fixing;,0.0
<br/>One of the bathrooms had a running out water problem with the neighbour downstairs. But it did not compromised our short stay.,0.0
<br/>One of the best part of the accommodation was the location it was in the prime area La Rambla! Traveling to the airport or by metro to many junctions was convienent ! ,0.0
<br/>One of the best well maintained flat in which i ever stayed. I would definitely suggest my friends to come back to the same flats as it is less than 5 mins walk to the beach. Also the interiors of the flat a perfect. ,0.0
<br/>One recommendation for future guests :,0.0
<br/>One room is very small and not for big people!!! Master bedroom is great! The last room is the sofa in the living room..,0.0
<br/>One thing - shower has no curtain which makes every shower a mission as you need to mop after yourself each time. Will be good if host can set a curtain to avoid this issue. ,0.0
<br/>One thing to note is that the apartment is up four floors of stairs and there is no lift. Just in case that might be an issue for anyone.,0.0
<br/>One tip for next visitors: don't mix this address with second similiar!:),0.0
<br/>Ongoing support is available ,0.0
<br/>Only 1 toilet and we were 7 people.  I would say shower in bathroom needs to be updated. ,0.0
<br/>Only complaint is i was charged 15 euros for car park. it is helpful if the car park is provided for free.,0.0
<br/>Only downside - the terrace use is not allowed by the building any more.,0.0
<br/>Only draw back to flat is the street can be loud most of the night due to bar next door and general street traffic.,0.0
<br/>Only minor negative is noise from street below.  Nice small balcony for reading and people watching. Barcelona stays up late so we had to keep windows closed and use the A/C but again this is minor concern. Unit very well located for walking to all neighborhoods and the underground/metro is but a block away.  Highly recommended.,0.0
<br/>Only minus would be the distribution of the rooms as the living room is connected to the bathroom only through the two bed-rooms available which can limit privacy.  ,0.0
<br/>Only negative point I can mention was that the 3rd bed in the picture was not there. Only the sofabed. But there was enough place for us and a perfect location to visit all Barcelona. Perfectly equipped apartment.,0.0
<br/>Only negative the second bed was very small suitable for a child but not an adult ,0.0
<br/>Only negative was the street noise but we got used to that. ,0.0
<br/>Only niggle with the flat was that the shower took some time to drain but Klaus mentioned that he would address the issue.,0.0
<br/>Only one key for 5 adults.,0.0
<br/>Only one problem- book early as I wanted to stay longer and it was already booked out. I guess I am not the only one who thinks this is a great apartment :),0.0
<br/>Only point why we gave 4 instead of 5 points is that the appartment is relatively noisy. The bed rooms are luckily in the back but the living room is facing the street and is loud.,0.0
<br/>Only slight downside was the moisture in the lower basement room. Although there were two dehumidifiers in the basement room we chose not to use this room.,0.0
<br/>Only small complaint was that the sofa was not very comfortable.,0.0
<br/>Only thing to note is the cooking facilities aren't very good if you would be planning on staying in on the evening - but no need to when you're in such a beautiful city!!,0.0

<br/>The neighbourhood of the apartment is very nice and central. Only a few minutes walk to several attractions in Barcelona. Everything in the apartment was very clean and tidy. ,0.0
<br/>The neighbourhood was just fine. The ladies in the Pharmacie across the road were very kind and assisted with a phone call and allowed us to leave our luggage there for the day. We felt safe walking along the roads in the area at night (two ladies).,0.0
<br/>The neighbourhood was quiet.,0.0
<br/>The neighbourhood was superb - especially for us!,0.0
<br/>The nights were quiet except for a dog in the neighborhood and the occasional ambulance on its way to the hospital across the street.,0.0
<br/>The only caution concerns the kitchen equipment (which is really basic and may not be sufficient for longer stays) and the terrasse which is really great but could be more valuable if it had better equipment.,0.0
<br/>The only downside is that it is on the 5th floor in a building with no elevator.,0.0
<br/>The only downside was the shower. It was really difficult to get consistent hot water during our stay =/. ,0.0
<br/>The only downside were the loud neighbours partying over the weekend at night.,0.0
<br/>The only downside: having to leave again. ,0.0
<br/>The only issue two nights was a loud hum that kept us up and only in the bedroom. It would start around 10pm. Not sure where it was coming from but out of Laura's control. ,0.0
<br/>The only issue was the noise. We live in countryside so the street was noisy for us as there is no double glass on windows. We had also some trouble with the upper neighbors making noise until 2 AM. ,0.0
<br/>The only issue was the noise: there is a lot of traffic in the main street and it can be difficult to sleep at night. ,0.0
<br/>The only let down was a school at the back that was utilised quite a lot and was fairly noisy at times. ,0.0
<br/>The only major issue we had was that there is only a door separating you front he next door apartment and especially the first night it was very noisy most of the night as they came back at 3 in the morning and were clattering dishes around. If your neighbours are quiet it wouldn't be a problem. ,0.0
<br/>The only minus was that the WiFi was not available if you were too far from the box but Florenza told me she would call the Internet company to get it fixed. ,0.0
<br/>The only negative thing is that the WIFI isn't working and the apartment doesn't look well cleaned. ,0.0
<br/>The only problem is that the bedroom is next to the main road and it is noisy.,0.0
<br/>The only problem is that there is no key for close the door of the room. ,0.0
<br/>The only reason why its not 5* is the fact that on the first morning we were woken up by Juan who was standing right in the bedroom and screaming to leave because we we're accused of throwing stuff from the balcony. Ringing on the door first instead of just entering flat and bedrooms would be nice.,0.0
<br/>The only thing disturbed us was the noise from the street in the 2 rooms located closer to the front of the building. If you are a deep sleeper or use to sleep with ear plugs you'll be just fine. ,0.0
<br/>The only thing is the neighborhood's dogs during the night.,0.0
<br/>The only thing that could be improved is the plumbing or drainage as there was a horrible sewage smell which we couldn't stand. Probably not Cristina's fault but maybe see if there is some way to mask the smell as the heat inside the home without aircon also made it even more unbearable some nights.,0.0
<br/>The only thing that happened with the host Hernan I thought was unusual was when we arrived he asked us to pay the Barcelona tourist tax in cash.  This was like $20 euros or something so not a big deal but I have not had anyone ask for extra cash upon arrival before through an Air BNB booking.  Well I argued this point that it should be in the description or price already and Hernan became upset and threatened to cancel the reservation (while we were in the apartment).  I was tired from travelling to just agreed to it and paid him.  He could tell i was agitated about the whole situation and declined the money.  I would think this could be avoidable by just raising the rent slightly.  That was my only issue the rest was great.,0.0
<br/>The only thing to note (especially with children or bigger parties) is that there very clear signs about making sure there was no noise between 10pm and 8am which we were slightly nervous about.,0.0
<br/>The opportunity to visit this great city without the restriction of a hotel was perfect.  Thank you.,0.0
<br/>The organisation by Damien and Karolina was super and the town is breathtaking. I would love to come back and to stay with Damien and his team. Thanks to all of you.,0.0

<br/>The outdoor patio was a wonderful feature. We used it every afternoon.,0.0
<br/>The overall experience was good - it is a very nice apartment and all the other facilities were good - but the host needs to arrange a more personal welcome and make sure everything is working before visitors arrive.,0.0

<br/>Yet there are a number of things to improve.,0.0
<br/>You are in the center of Barcelona ,0.0
<br/>You can get to all places quite fast and a Metro Station is right outside the building. ,0.0
<br/>You can reach a lot of spots easily by feet and a Metro Station is as close as it could be.,0.0
<br/>You can walk or take the subway to almost any place in Barcelona from this location. It is very central and a two minute walk to Las Ramblas etc.,0.0
<br/>You got  everything you need to have a comfortable stay,0.0
<br/>You have a great view from the terrace.  ,0.0
<br/>You have an incredible view over Barcelona and the everything you need is just a few meters away from the house.,0.0
<br/>You have to read what is included in the listing since there are items missing other AirBnB's of the same level offer (e.g. no detergent for the washer so we had to buy the smallest we can get but we had to leave it behind since we can not bring it back home). ,0.0
<br/>You might take into consideration that it is not in the central neighborhoods.   there is a bus that takes you to Cataluna place (num 24) and a metro station 10 min from the apt. The walk from the metro back to the apt is a steep rise (not that convenient at the end of the day). Otherwise the neighborhood is residential and very quiet. Therefore the soirees and lunch are spent considerably far away.,0.0
<br/>You should really get a permanent internet line there. Everybody needs internet! So many people before commented already about it. Now it is time to change!,0.0
<br/>You were very thoughtful to provide us with a food hamper and a bottle of bubble for my birthday and we appreciated all your advise.,0.0

<br/>the appartment has best location . very comftable and give you a home feeling. good wi fii. ,0.0
<br/>the appartment is also very good. Pictures are making it a little bigger than what it is but it's a real 3 rooms appartment with a lot a lot of games for babies and children.

Other important thing: the lift to go to the appartment is big - so no problem to go there with big trolleys (again if you have children),0.0

<br/>the bad is that there was a bad sewage smell in the building hallways and much worse downstairs. it permeated the apartment slightly too. this has  been mentioned in another review. when i told anne about it she did send someone over and it seemed to lessen but not totally go away. anne also has made up her own rules regarding check in. she requires you to be there between 17.00 and 20.00 and if you come late you are charged a fine. i find that outrageous as a business person. ,0.0
<br/>the bad thing of this apartment: probably the balcony is very very small (seems a little bigger in the picture) and for those come in summer wanting to spend your evenings in this balcony please double check with MArta: there is a some noise coming from I don't know what (air conditioner of the building in front?) that makes it a little unpleasant to spend a evening in that balcony. .,0.0
